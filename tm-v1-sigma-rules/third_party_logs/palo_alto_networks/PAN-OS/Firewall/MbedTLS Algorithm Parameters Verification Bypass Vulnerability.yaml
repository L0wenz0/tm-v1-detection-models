title: MbedTLS Algorithm Parameters Verification Bypass Vulnerability
description: Palo Alto Networks detection for MbedTLS Algorithm Parameters Verification Bypass Vulnerability. MbedTLS is prone to a verification bypass vulnerability while parsing certain crafted TLS responses. The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper checks on TLS responses, leading to an exploitable verification bypass vulnerability. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending crafted TLS responses. A successful attack could lead to information disclosure with the privileges of the currently logged-in user.
