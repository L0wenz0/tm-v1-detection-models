title: Microsoft Windows SMB NTLM Authentication Lack of Entropy Vulnerability
description: Palo Alto Networks detection for Microsoft Windows SMB NTLM Authentication Lack of Entropy Vulnerability. This signature detects an unauthenticated elevation of privilege vulnerability is SMB Protocol. An attempt to exploit the vulnerability would not require authentication, allowing an attacker to exploit the vulnerability by sending large amounts of authentication requests to the SMB server. This signature triggers when the child signature triggers 20 times within 10 second. Customers can adjust the timing of brute force signatures if the parent signatures trigger too often. Refer to Palo Alto Networks documentation to learn more about brute force signatures and customizing the action and trigger conditions for a brute force signature.
