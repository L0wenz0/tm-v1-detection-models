title: HTTP2 Protocol Denial-of-Service Vulnerability
description: Palo Alto Networks detection for HTTP2 Protocol Denial-of-Service Vulnerability. All HTTP2 Implementation are prone to a denial-of-service vulnerability. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a lot of HTTP2 RST_STREAM frames in HTTP2 requests. A successful attack could lead to denial-of-service. This signature triggers when the child signature, HTTP2 Protocol Suspicious RST_STREAM Frame Detection (ID 94441) triggers 9 times within 3 seconds. Customers can adjust the timing of brute force signatures if the parent signatures trigger too often. Please refer to Palo Alto Networks documentation to learn more about brute force signatures and customizing the action and trigger conditions for a brute force signature.
