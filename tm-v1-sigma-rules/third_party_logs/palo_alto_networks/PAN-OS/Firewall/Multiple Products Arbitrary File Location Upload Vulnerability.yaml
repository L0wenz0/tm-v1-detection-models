title: Multiple Products Arbitrary File Location Upload Vulnerability
description: Palo Alto Networks detection for Multiple Products Arbitrary File Location Upload Vulnerability. Multiple products are prone to an arbitrary file location upload vulnerability while handling certain crafted HTTP requests. The vulnerability is due to the improper handling of the Content-Disposition MIME header. An attacker could control the location of an uploaded file by supplying an arbitrary file name and path through this header. A successful exploit could cause malicious files to be uploaded to an arbitrary location on the vulnerable system, leading to arbitrary code execution.
