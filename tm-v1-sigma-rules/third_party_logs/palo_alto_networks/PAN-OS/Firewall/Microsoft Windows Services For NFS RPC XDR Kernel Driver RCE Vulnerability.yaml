description: Palo Alto Networks detection for Microsoft Windows Services for NFS RPC XDR Kernel Driver Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. Microsoft Windows NFS RPC XDR Kernel Driver is prone to an out-of-bound memory write vulnerability while parsing certain crafted NFS requests. The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper checks on NFS requests, leading to an exploitable out-of-bound memory write vulnerability. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending crafted NFS requests. A successful attack could lead to remote code execution with the privileges of the server.
