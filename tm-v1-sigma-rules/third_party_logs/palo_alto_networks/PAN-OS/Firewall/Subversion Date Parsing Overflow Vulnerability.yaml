title: Subversion Date Parsing Overflow Vulnerability
description: Palo Alto Networks detection for Subversion Date Parsing Overflow Vulnerability. Subversion versions 1.0.2 and earlier are prone to a stack overflow vulnerability while handling certain crafted requests. The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper boundary checks on the get-dated-rev command parameters. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a crafted command to the vulnerable server. A successful exploit could lead to remote code execution with the privileges of the Subversion server.
