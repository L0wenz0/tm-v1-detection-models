title: RSA PKCS1 Cryptographic Vulnerability
description: Palo Alto Networks detection for RSA PKCS1 Cryptographic Vulnerability. RSA PKCS is prone to a cryptographic vulnerability while parsing certain crafted TLS requests. The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper checks on TLS requests, leading to an exploitable cryptographic vulnerability. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending crafted TLS requests. A successful attack could lead to information disclosure with the privileges of the server.
