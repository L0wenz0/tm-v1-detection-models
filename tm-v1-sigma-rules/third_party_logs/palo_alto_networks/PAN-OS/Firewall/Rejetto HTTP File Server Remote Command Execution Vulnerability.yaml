description: Palo Alto Networks detection for Rejetto HTTP File Server Remote Command Execution Vulnerability. Rejetto HTTPFileServer is prone to a remote command execution vulnerability while parsing certain crafted HTTP requests. The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper handling of regular expressions in the file ParserLib.pas.
