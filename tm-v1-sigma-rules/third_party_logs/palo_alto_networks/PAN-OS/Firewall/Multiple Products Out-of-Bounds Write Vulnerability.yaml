description: Palo Alto Networks detection for Multiple Products Out-of-Bounds Write Vulnerability. Multiple products are prone to an out-of-bounds write vulnerability while parsing certain crafted DNS responses. The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper checks on DNS responses, leading to an exploitable out-of-bounds write vulnerability. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending crafted DNS responses. A successful attack could lead to remote code execution with the privileges of the server.
