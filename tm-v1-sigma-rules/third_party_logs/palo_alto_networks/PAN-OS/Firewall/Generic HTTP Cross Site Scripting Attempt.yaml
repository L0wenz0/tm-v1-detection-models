title: Generic HTTP Cross Site Scripting Attempt
description: Palo Alto Networks detection for Generic HTTP Cross Site Scripting Attempt. This signature detects suspected attempts to locate and/or exploit cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in a web application. XSS vulnerabilities are created by a lack of proper checks on HTTP requests. An attacker could exploit XSS vulnerabilities by sending a crafted HTTP request that executes arbitrary javascript in user's browser, leading to cookie theft and other data leakage. This signature specifically checks the HTTP request path for an attempted injection of javascript. This is commonly used to test URI paths for javascript injection vulnerabilities.
