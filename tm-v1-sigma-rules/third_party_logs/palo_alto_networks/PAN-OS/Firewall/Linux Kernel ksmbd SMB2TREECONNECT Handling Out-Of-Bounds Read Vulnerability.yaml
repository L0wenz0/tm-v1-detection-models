title: Linux Kernel ksmbd SMB2TREECONNECT Handling Out-Of-Bounds Read Vulnerability
description: Palo Alto Networks detection for Linux Kernel ksmbd SMB2TREECONNECT Handling Out-Of-Bounds Read Vulnerability. Linux Kernel Project Kernel is prone to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability while parsing certain crafted SMB/CIFS requests. The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper checks on SMB/CIFS requests, leading to an exploitable out-of-bounds read vulnerability. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a crafted SMB/CIFS request. A successful attack could lead to denial-of-service.
