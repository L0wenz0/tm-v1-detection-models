title: TP-Link Remote Command Injection Vulnerability
description: Palo Alto Networks detection for TP-Link Remote Command Injection Vulnerability. TP-Link is prone to a remote command injection vulnerability while parsing certain crafted HTTP requests. The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper checks on HTTP requests, leading to an exploitable remote command injection vulnerability. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP requests. A successful attack could lead to remote code execution with the privileges of the server.
